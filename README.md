### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My username is TheWitheredStriker, but just call me Wither. I'm a novice programmer with ambitions in software development and gamedev. While I'm not particularly good at programming right _now_, I'm hoping to soon change that! While I learn the basics of programming in school, I can't say it suffices for the real deal, and for that reason, I am planning to teach myself, through tutorials, experimentation, trial and error, testing and online documentation. 

I'm mainly interested in desktop software development, mobile development, gamedev (and modding), systems programming, ROM hacking and to a lesser degree cloud computing, servers and reverse engineering. I'm not interested in web development, most algorithms, computational science or statistics, AI and robotics. This largely affects my programming language choices.
