### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My username is TheWitheredStriker, but just call me Wither (or Midas). I'm a novice programmer from Flanders with ambitions in software development and gamedev. While I'm not particularly good at programming right _now_, I'm hoping to soon change that! I currently attend college, where I'm taking programming classes.

I'm mainly interested in desktop software development, gamedev (and modding) and ROM hacking. To a lesser extent, I'm also interested in back-end web development and mobile development. I'm not interested in front-end web development, computational science or statistics, networking, AI and robotics. 

### Programming languages I want to learn
This is the current list of programming languages I want to learn in order.
- [ ] C#
- [ ] VB.NET
- [ ] C++
- [ ] D
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] Common Lisp
- [ ] Assembly

I'm also interested in several other programming languages, though only time will tell if I'll pick them up:
- F#
- Scala
- Pascal
- Clojure
- Forth
- Factor
- Smalltalk
- Elixir
- Nim
