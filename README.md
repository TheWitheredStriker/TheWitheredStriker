Aspiring (but currently notice) novice programmer from Flanders, with ambitions in software development and gamedev. Online, I go by the name Wither (or Midas).

I'm mainly interested in desktop/mobile software development, gamedev (and modding), and ROM hacking. I also fancy back-end development to a degree. 

I am not interested in front-end web development, computational science or statistics, AI, and robotics. 

I currently only really consider myself particularly skilled with C#, but I want to learn many more technologies over the course of my career, including (but not limited to) C++, Assembly, Lisp, Forth, and the JVM world. I also want to try Emacs.

I'm likely going to update this description later on.
