### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My username is TheWitheredStriker, but just call me Wither. I'm a novice programmer with ambitions in software development and gamedev. While I'm not particularly good at programming right _now_, I'm hoping to soon change that! While I learn the basics of programming in school, I can't say it suffices for the real deal, and for that reason, I am planning to teach myself, through tutorials, experimentation, trial and error, testing and online documentation. 

I'm mainly interested in desktop software development, mobile development, gamedev (and modding), systems programming, ROM hacking and to a lesser degree cloud computing, servers and reverse engineering. I'm not interested in web development, most algorithms, computational science or statistics, AI and robotics. This largely affects my programming language choices.

### Me and programming

As of now, I am currently learning C# in college; in my spare time, I plan to learn F#, Scala, Lisp, Factor, Forth, C++, Assembly, LiveScript, Kotlin, Java and Elixir. There are several other languages I also look at with interest, like Lua, Nim, V, Haxe, Pascal, Zig, Smalltalk, Swift, Nemerle, Erlang, Boo and D, among several others (including some obscure languages that I'm curious about, like Fantom, Golo, Gosu, Xtend, Beef, High Level Assembly and Ceylon), but I'm not sure which of them I'll actually learn. As an aspiring game modder, I also eye languages like MCFunction, UnrealScript, Pawn / SourcePawn, Squirrel and GSC.

I don't really like Python, Rust, PHP, Go, Prolog, Fortran, Haskell and Elm, and aside from very possibly checking out Rust out of pure curiosity and to see why everyone loves it so much, I do not expect to look into them. I'm also not a JavaScript fan.

Other languages are up in the middle. I don't rule out the possibility of investigating them, but have no explicit plans to pick them up either.

I'm also one of the 17 people on Earth who, somehow, are interested in learning COBOL. Then again, I _am_ a madman. But on the other hand, due to COBOL's horrible reputation (which drives off the overwhelming majority of coders from learning it) and the retirement of existing COBOL programmers, the demand for a new, "fresh" generation of COBOL programmers has **exploded** among the surprisingly many companies and governmental organizations that still rely on it. Hence, I plan to unironically study COBOL so I can fill this gap in the market.

My main IDE's of preference are Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA; I also plan to look into Vim and Emacs later on. I develop on Windows, though I also run Ubuntu on my PC.
